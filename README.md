## Holbegram (or Atlasgram) Final Flutter Project

### Introduction

Developing a mobile application using the technology of Flutter and Dart frameworks. Traditionally, Android relies on Java, while iOS uses Objective-C or Swift, requiring developers to manage two codebases if they wish to support both platforms. 

Enter **Flutter**: a powerful and streamlined framework that utilizes Dart. Flutter simplifies the process by allowing us to write a single codebase for both platforms, rendering directly onto the OS's canvas for high performance and smooth user experience.

### Getting Started

Before diving into the code, I recommend checking out the following resources to set a solid foundation and enhance your understanding of Flutter and its ecosystem:

- [Dart - Cheatsheet](https://dart.dev/resources/dart-cheatsheet)
- [FlutterFire Overview](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview/)
- [Getting Started with Firebase on Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXp0gq9kGxI&t=780s&ab_channel=Firebase)
- [Get Started with Firebase Authentication on Flutter](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/auth/start/)
- [Cloud Storage on Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/flutter/start)
- [Layouts in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout)
- [Introduction to Widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui)
- [Firebase Storage Load and Display Images | Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQQJJw3zOqs&ab_channel=dbestech)
- [Every Flutter Widget Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj_tldMmu4w)

#### Dependencies

Ensure these dependencies are included in your project:

- [Firebase Database Plugin for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_database)
- [Firebase Auth for Flutter]
- [Cloud Firestore Plugin for Flutter]
- Cloud Storage for Flutter
- Cupertino Icons
- Image Picker plugin for Flutter
- BottomNavyBar
- provider
- Uuid
- Cached network image
- Flutter Pull To Refresh

### Project Setup

To kick off your project, follow these steps in your command-line tool:

```bash
flutter create holbegram
cd holbegram
flutter run
```

### Setting Up Firebase

For the backend, we will utilize Firebase—a comprehensive BaaS platform that supports features like a real-time database, cloud storage, authentication, and much more.

#### Steps to Integrate Firebase:

1. Visit [Firebase's website](https://firebase.google.com/) and create an account.
2. Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click 'Add Project'.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up a new project called `holbegram`.

### Let’s Embark on This Journey

Though the task may seem challenging, especially with limited Flutter experience, remember: we are Holberton students, and there is nothing we can't achieve. I believe in you all and am excited to see what you create.
